# LIGHTNING/BUG
## Screenplay

**FADE IN:**

### 1. EXT. TRAILER HOME - DUSK

*A small tin trailer sits alone at the edge of a vast Kansas wheat field. The sun is setting, painting the sky in deep oranges and purples. A single street light flickers on beside power lines that stretch into the distance. Storm clouds gather on the horizon.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
(warm, nostalgic)
I step out of that tiny tin trailer at 10 years old, yellow wiffle ball bat in hand, to observe a distant summer storm brewing beyond the glow of a single street light.

*A YOUNG BOY (10) emerges from the trailer, clutching a yellow wiffle ball bat. He gazes at the approaching storm, then at the street light, transformers, and power lines.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
It's getting dark. Ominous.

*The boy takes a step back toward the trailer door.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
I better go back inside to worry before we have to go to a basement at the neighbor's house a few blocks away.

*The boy hesitates, looking once more at the darkening sky.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
You know, a typical summer evening in August, when the harvest is over but the sun remains angry.

### 2. EXT. TRAILER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

*The boy stands on a small wooden porch, pointing his bat toward the distant horizon like Babe Ruth calling his shot. A single LIGHTNING BUG lands on the end of the bat.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
A lightning bug lands on my bat that I have stretched out like Babe Ruth calling his shot for another day.

*The lightning bug GLOWS, illuminating the yellow bat with an otherworldly light.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
When it glows, it lights up my bat...

*The wooden porch begins to DETACH from the trailer, floating slightly above the ground. The boy looks down in wonder.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
...and our movable wooden porch takes off for a maiden voyage to explore a familiar wheat field.

### 3. EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DUSK

*The small wooden porch FLOATS across a ditch separating the dirt road from a vast golden wheat field. The boy stands at the edge of the porch, bat still glowing, eyes wide with wonder.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
The ditch between the dirt road and the wheat field becomes a bridge between 1983 and 2083.

*As the porch moves deeper into the field, more lightning bugs begin to appear, first dozens, then hundreds, then thousands, illuminating the entire field in a soft, golden glow. In the distance, lightning flashes silently.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
That single lightning bug turns into a trillion, an audience for a sports kid to take a few swings as lightning and thunder roar from fieldside seats.

### 4. EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT - BASEBALL SEQUENCE

*The wooden porch has transformed into something resembling a dugout. The boy steps off, tapping his tennis shoes like a baseball player and holding his glowing bat.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
I walk off the porch like it's a dugout, tapping my tennis shoes like cleats with my Wander Boy bat aglow, taking my stance in the batter's box.

*The boy assumes a batting stance in the middle of the wheat field. The lightning bugs form a circular pattern around him, like stadium lights. Storm clouds swirl overhead.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Here comes the pitch, a fastball right down the pipe.

*The boy swings hard but connects with nothing. He looks confused.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Swing and a miss. What? This bat might be more worthless than a real one.

*The storm clouds overhead swirl into an impossible curve pattern. Lightning flashes.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Giant curveball comes next, quickly. It catches me off guard, and I don't even swing.

*The power lines in the distance begin to glow with electric blue energy. The humming grows louder.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Now the artificial light, transformers and power lines are humming like gospel, giving me confidence where there was a dirt cloud of doubt.

*The wheat field is now surrounded by a glowing blue electrical boundary, like a baseball stadium. The lightning bugs cluster together, resembling stadium crowds.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Now the square field is lit up around the boundaries, glowing like neon signs in Vegas.

*The boy rocks back and forth, preparing for another pitch. His expression shows intense concentration.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
The final pitch is a change up. I rock back and forth in the batter's box, patiently.

*He swings with all his might. As the bat connects with an invisible ball, there's a FLASH of light.*

### 5. EXT. COSMIC SPACE - TIMELESS

*A glowing orb (the "ball") sails through a star-filled void, leaving trails of light behind it. The background transitions from night sky to abstract cosmic nebula.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
I take a furious swing out of my shoes, and launch it toward a constellation of stars that turns the sky black, the glowing orb sailing not just past the Kansas River, but into a new dimension.

*The orb expands, revealing swirling visions: vintage electronics morphing into futuristic technology, DNA strands intertwining with circuit boards, wheat seeds growing into digital trees.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Entrails of space, time, innovation, heritage, human purpose, machine potential flash like rocket fuel, an electric boogaloo of quantum proportions.

*The cosmic vision reaches a crescendo of light and energy, then suddenly COLLAPSES into darkness.*

### 6. EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

*Nearly complete darkness. A single point of bioluminescent light (the lightning bug) glows in the center. The silhouette of the boy is barely visible.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
The storm has passed. No electricity. No porch. No bat. Just darkness and that single lightning bug that greeted me in the beginning, right in front of my face.

*The boy's expression shows fear in the faint glow.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Now I'm terrified. Is this a dream? How do I find my way back across the bridge and into the single bed of our tiny tin trailer?

*The lightning bug begins to move slowly toward the distant trailer, creating just enough light for the boy to follow.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
There's just enough light from my new bioluminescent critter to guide the way home. It was the one who powered my bat. It was the one who got me home safely when the power went out.

### 7. INT. TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

*The boy lies in bed, eyes open. His face is illuminated by two light sources: a firefly in a jar on his bedside table, and the faint glow of electricity returning to a small lamp. Shadows on the ceiling resemble both a wheat field and a circuit board.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
I wake up in a sweat. Mind racing. My eyes find a light on the ceiling, just enough to tell me where I am.

*CLOSE ON: The firefly in the jar, glowing softly.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
It's that bug.

*The small lamp flickers, power returning.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
And the lighting has returned, confirming it.

*The boy looks between the two light sources, a small smile forming.*

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**THE END**
