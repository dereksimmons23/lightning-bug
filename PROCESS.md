### Visual Sequence Breakdown

| Sequence | Time | Description | Visual Style | AI Prompt Guidance |
|----------|------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1. Opening Trailer | 0:00-0:15 | Boy emerging from trailer, storm clouds | Photorealistic, nostalgic glow | Cinematic scene, 1980s Kansas, trailer home at dusk, approaching storm, single street light, warm golden-hour lighting |
| 2. Lightning Bug Encounter | 0:15-0:45 | Bug lands on bat, porch detaches | Magical realism | Close-up of glowing firefly landing on yellow wiffle bat, bioluminescent glow, twilight ambiance, dreamlike quality |
| 3. Wheat Field Journey | 0:45-1:30 | Floating into field, fireflies gathering | Surrealist landscape | Wooden porch floating over golden wheat field, thousands of fireflies creating stadium-like illumination, distant lightning, magical night scene |
| 4. Baseball Sequence | 1:30-2:45 | Three pitches, field transformation | Sports film meets fantasy | Boy in batter's stance, swirling storm clouds, power lines glowing with electric blue energy, wheat field transformed into baseball stadium |
| 5. Cosmic Home Run | 2:45-3:30 | Ball traveling through cosmos | Abstract cosmic visualization | Baseball transforming into glowing orb traveling through space, cosmic nebula, DNA strands intertwining with circuit boards, technological evolution visualization |
| 6. Return to Darkness | 3:30-4:15 | Power outage, single firefly guide | Minimalist night scene | Nearly black image with single point of bioluminescent light, silhouette of boy, stark contrast between darkness and single light source |
| 7. Awakening | 4:15-5:00 | Boy in bed, dual light sources | Intimate interior scene | Boy in bed illuminated by firefly in jar and returning electric light, shadows on ceiling resembling both wheat field and circuit board patterns |

### Audio Production Plan

#### Narration Recording Setup
- **Equipment**: USB microphone with pop filter
- **Location**: Small room with soft furnishings (minimize echo)
- **Technique**: Record multiple takes with different emotional emphases
- **Processing**: Light compression, subtle reverb for dreamlike quality
- **Timing**: Record full narration, then edit to match visual pacing

#### Sound Design Elements
- **Natural Sounds**:
  - Cricket chirping (gradually increasing/decreasing)
  - Wind through wheat (subtle whooshing)
  - Distant thunder (building in intensity)
  - Wooden porch creaking
  - Baseball bat swinging through air

- **Technological Sounds**:
  - Electric hum (power lines)
  - Transformer buzzing
  - Power outage sound (sudden silence)
  - Power return sound (electrical hum returning)
  - Digital processing (for cosmic sequence)

- **Musical Elements**:
  - Opening: Minimal acoustic guitar or piano
  - Lightning bug encounter: Add subtle electronic elements
  - Baseball sequence: Building percussive tension
  - Cosmic sequence: Full electronic/ambient expansion
  - Return: Stripped back to minimal elements
  - Awakening: Blend of acoustic and electronic sounds

### Leonardo.AI Prompt Structure

For consistent results across all images, structure Leonardo prompts with these elements:

```
[Subject]: [Detailed description of main focal point]
[Setting/Environment]: [Description of location and surroundings]
[Lighting]: [Specific lighting conditions and sources]
[Mood/Emotion]: [Emotional tone of the scene]
[Composition]: [How elements are arranged in frame]
[Style]: [Cinematic, photorealistic, magical realism, etc.]
[Technical]: [Camera angle, focus, depth of field]
```

#### Example Core Prompts:

1. **Opening Trailer Scene**:
```
Subject: Young boy (10 years old) in 1980s clothing stepping out of small tin trailer home, yellow wiffle ball bat in hand
Setting: Rural Kansas at dusk, vast wheat fields, single street light, power lines stretching to horizon, storm clouds gathering
Lighting: Golden hour sunlight mixed with approaching storm darkness, single street light beginning to glow
Mood: Nostalgic, slightly ominous, curious
Composition: Wide establishing shot showing isolation of trailer against vast landscape
Style: Cinematic, photorealistic with subtle dreamlike quality
Technical: Low angle shot, deep focus showing both boy and distant storm, 35mm film look
```

2. **Firefly Illumination Scene**:
```
Subject: Thousands of fireflies illuminating a Kansas wheat field like a baseball stadium, young boy in center with glowing yellow wiffle bat
Setting: Night-time wheat field, distant storm clouds with occasional lightning
Lighting: Natural bioluminescent glow from fireflies, occasional flashes of lightning, no artificial light
Mood: Wonder, awe, magical
Composition: Circular composition with boy at center, fireflies creating dome of light
Style: Magical realism, enhanced natural phenomenon
Technical: Low angle shot looking up at firefly dome, shallow depth of field focusing on boy, atmospheric perspective showing depth of field
```

### Editing Approach

1. **Pacing Strategy**:
   - Begin with slower, contemplative pacing (longer shots)
   - Accelerate during baseball sequence
   - Explosive pace during cosmic sequence
   - Return to slower, reflective pacing for conclusion

2. **Transition Types**:
   - Gradual dissolves between early scenes
   - Match cuts during baseball sequence
   - Rapid montage for cosmic sequence
   - Fade to black/from black for final transitions

3. **Color Grading Guide**:
   - Natural scenes: Warm amber/golden palette
   - Technological elements: Cool blue/white tones
   - Cosmic sequence: Vibrant multicolor expansion
   - Final scene: Balanced between warm and cool
