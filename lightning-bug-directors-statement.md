# Director's Statement: LIGHTNING/BUG

## The Genesis of Dual Light

Growing up in a small Kansas town in the early 1980s meant experiencing illumination in its most contrasting forms. On summer evenings, I'd stand at the edge of wheat fields where countless fireflies performed their bioluminescent ballet, while behind me, the harsh electric lights of tennis courts and street lamps carved rigid boundaries into the darkness. This childhood memory – this tangible experience of dual illumination – has unexpectedly become my lens for understanding our current technological moment.

LIGHTNING/BUG emerged from my reflection on this memory during a period of profound professional transition. What had been a personal recollection suddenly revealed itself as a metaphor for our present inflection point – the tension between artificial light (technology) and natural illumination (human wisdom), the liminal space of power lines between human paths and natural realms, the fear and wonder of entering unknown territory.

## The Elegance of Natural Systems

The firefly's bioluminescence represents what I consider "elegant" design – a natural system evolved over millennia that produces light with nearly 100% efficiency, requiring no external power source, creating no waste heat. It's a perfect metaphor for what we might aspire to in our technological development: sustainable, efficient, and beautiful.

In contrast, our human technologies – from the power grid of my childhood to today's artificial intelligence systems – often prioritize utility over elegance. They solve immediate problems while creating new ones, imposing rigid structures that sometimes fail to honor natural patterns.

Through LIGHTNING/BUG, I'm exploring whether we can maintain our appreciation for the elegant (fireflies) while engaging with the useful (electricity) – whether wonder and utility can coexist rather than compete. The film doesn't argue against technological advancement but asks how we might integrate it more harmoniously with our natural wisdom.

## From Personal Memory to Universal Question

Setting this exploration within the framework of a childhood baseball fantasy allows me to ground abstract concepts in tangible, relatable experience. The boy's journey from the safety of his trailer home into the wheat fields mirrors our collective journey into unexplored technological territories. His three symbolic pitches represent our attempts to connect with new technologies – sometimes missing entirely, sometimes being overwhelmed, and sometimes connecting in transformative ways.

By framing the narrative between 1983 and 2083, I'm deliberately creating a 100-year span that places us at the midpoint – a moment of decision about how the relationship between human and artificial intelligence might evolve. The film doesn't offer definitive answers but invites contemplation about possible futures.

## Visual and Technical Approach

Creating this film through AI generation tools like Runway represents another layer of meaning – using the very technology I'm examining to create art that questions our relationship with that technology. This self-reflexive approach feels honest and necessary.

I've deliberately designed contrasting visual elements: the golden glow of fireflies against the harsh blue-white of electric lights; the organic, flowing movements of the wheat field against the rigid geometry of power lines; the intimate scale of a child's perspective against the cosmic expansion of the home run sequence.

The sound design similarly juxtaposes natural elements (cricket songs, wind through wheat) with technological ones (electric hum, transformers) before ultimately suggesting a potential harmony between them.

## A Personal Note

This film arrives at a pivotal moment in my own journey. After decades in media leadership, I'm exploring how frameworks like pattern recognition and authentic relationships might help navigate our relationship with emerging technologies. LIGHTNING/BUG is both a personal exploration and a public invitation to consider how we might carry forward what matters most – our capacity for wonder, for play, for connection – as we step into technological territories previously unimaginable.

Like the boy in the film, I believe we need both types of light: the natural wisdom that guides us home and the technological illumination that expands our horizons. The question isn't whether to choose between them, but how to integrate them in ways that honor our full humanity.
